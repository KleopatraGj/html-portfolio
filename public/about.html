<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a passionate and motivated recent computer science graduate. I have gained experience of multiple programming languages
  through different projects. I am an excellent problem solver who can diagnose and troubleshoot hardware, software and other 
  technical problems efficiently.

<p>
  I am currently working on a Web Development Bootcamp. This Webpage will be my protfolio with all the Web development projects.
  Some of those projects will be as simple as using only headers and paragraphs, and others will be more complicated and will contain
  CSS and Javascript. As I will br working to more complicated things the user interface of the website will become better and better.

  For my own privacy, for some projects that required me to implement something with information about myself, I have used false
  information. Any location links provided have been found randomly on google maps, or have been provided through the Bootcamp.
