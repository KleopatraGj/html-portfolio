<h3>Movie #1: The Sound of Music</h3>
<p>
    The Sound of Music is an excellent musical. Contains a loving story
    as well as some drama that will keep your attention. The suspense and 
    the stress that are created when you arrive at the dark par of the movies
    are keeping you there to keep going until you know what is happening to 
    the characters.

<h3>Movie #2: V For Vendetta</h3>
<p>
    V for Vendetta is related more to some political matters that are taking
    place in the United Kingdom. This man, who seemed to have been a prisoner
    because of his skin, actions, sexuality is trying to overthrow the government
    in England. He is getting the attention of a young journalist and he is trying
    in some sort of inhumane way to make her realize that the government was doing
    all she went through to a lot of people. The suspense, the drama, and the story
    of this movie makes you wonder if in all the countries the government is taking 
    similar actions towards people who are different from what the majority of the 
    population is used to, which we like to call as the norm. 
</p>

<h3>Movie #3: The Fast and Furious Series</h3>
<p>
    Do you like cars? Do you like action? Do you like solving mysteries along
    the police, FBI or other agencies? This is a great movie to watch. It Contains
    fancy cars, speed, and some crazy action scenes that are worth watching. Of course,
    there is drama involved, and a lot of killing, but that's what makes these movies.
    You are there to watch Vin Diesel, as well as Paul Walker, who is currently dead in 
    real life, but these are the movies that will make you understand how good of an
    actor he was.
